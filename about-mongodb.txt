MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented database that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.
Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema.
MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).

MongoDB lets you store things (called documents) inside databases.

Database
Database is a physical container for collections.
Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases.

Collection
Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table.
A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have different fields.
Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.

Document
A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema.
Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure,
and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data.

The following table shows the relationship of RDBMS terminology with MongoDB.
RDBMS 	    |    MongoDB
Database 	|    Database
Table 	    |    Collection
Tuple/Row 	|    Document
column 	    |    Field
Table Join 	|    Embedded Documents
Primary Key |	 Primary Key (Default key _id provided by MongoDB itself)
